## Commands:

- `npm install` to install dependancies
- `npm run dev` to start dev server
- `npm run build` to create prod build
- `npm run start` to start prod server (need to run `build` first)

### Frontend stack:
- Nextjs
- Styled components
- Typescript

### Mock data
To run application you need to run `fontem-FE-assignment` server, which provides mock data for this app

### Possible improvements
- Font sizes should be listed in a separate file, included in theme and used from there. (Was kind of hard to make a list of all font sizes used on website without proper overview like styleguide)
- Some of the styles, that are duplicated throuth the app, could be moved also to mixins as Button was moved (Was not obvious for me which one since it's only one page)
- I also have a feeling that typing may be improved over the codebase but since it's my first attempt with this stack I was not sure if that would be appropriate in some places, it felt like double checking on yourself sometimes so I decided to leave it as it is
- Any comments how created app can be improved would be very much appreciated ;)
